#Each year, the Environmental Working Group releases its "Dirty Dozen," a list of the fruits and vegetables you usually buy that are laden with the most pesticides. This year's edition is no less depressing than last year's (nice to see you again, strawberries), but it's important nonetheless.


fruits = ["Strawberries", "Nectarines", "Apples", "Grapes", "Peaches", "Cherries", "Pears"]
vegetables = ["Spinach", "Kale", "Tomatoes", "Celery", "Potatoes"]

dirty_dozen = [fruits, vegetables]
